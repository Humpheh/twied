This project contains the `Twitter Event Detection Toolkit` (TwiED), a set of various modules for use in inferring location, collecting tweets and detecting events.

The project was originally created for use in my dissertation, however it has been documented and edited for use as a standalone package. Documentation for this can be found here http://humpheh.github.io/twied/.
